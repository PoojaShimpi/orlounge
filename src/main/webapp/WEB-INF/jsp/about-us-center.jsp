        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>
            Our core mission is to enable surgical communities to communicate among their members within their respective surgical or surgical nursing groups.
            We want to encourage collaboration and sharing among members of existing surgical groups.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Operating Room is a logical surgical group to start. Any Hospital Operating  Room can create a private Operating Room Lounge Site for themselves.
            Social media tools are freely available for members to use.Using these tools, members can work together, share their thoughts, and collaborate. Each site is tightly organized to create a familiar surgical environment and its management reflects the real operating room.
            Such an operating room lounge site becomes a messaging site, a productivity and a management tool. An operating room lounge sitecan increase personal and professional productivity and improve patient care.
            </p>
            <p>
            For the first time, each operating room can form their own private groups, and use social media tools for productive work. This is accomplished by designing a well organized, and structured site that is managed locally. The site also incorporates management tools to prevent and avoid chaos and disruptive behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="www.orlounge.com">www.orlounge.com</a> also addresses the unique privacy and security concerns of healthcare social media site:
            </p>
            <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The OR Manager of an operating room (or her assistant) approves a siteâ€™s creation. She/he also approves or rejects local membership because she/he knows the members.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The OR Manager (or her assistant) is the local site administrator
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Local site administrators maintain and control content for non-HIPPA compliance, inappropriate behavior or otherwise disruptive behavior.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Hospital photo ID are required for membership.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Only hospital computers can login to protect the privacy of the hospital
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Intrusive display ads are forbidden
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            For nurses and surgeons who want to use the site, balancing security and convenience is always challenging.  One size does not fit all. Exceptions need to be made for those who want  site access from outside the hospital.  Members may like to use different devices to access the site. www. ORLounge.com  canprovide the enabling technologies but its  implementation is only as good and effective as its members want it to be.
            These are best left to the local site administrators.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="www.orlounge.com">www.orlounge.com</a> is a work in progress. New features will be introduced later.<br/>
            New groups will be added in the future. New technology enjoyed by the technology crowd will be be introduced if they are useful.
                New services will be developed in the future.<br/>

            And all these are free for the surgical and surgical nursing community to use.<br/>

            We hope all those who are involved in the care of the surgical patient will take advantage of this site.<br/>
