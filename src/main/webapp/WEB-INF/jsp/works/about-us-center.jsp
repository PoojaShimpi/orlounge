            <p>
                 Our core mission is to enable surgical groups to communicate among their members.
             </p>
            <p>
                The Operating Room is a logical surgical group to start.
                Any Hospital Operating Room can create a private Operating Room Lounge Site to work together.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each site is tightly and simply organized to facilitate communication and manage the flow of information.
                Every one in the operating room is familiar with its features.
                We have placed frequently needed information is in one place and the ability to discuss them.

                The site is a messaging center, a productivity tools and a management tool.
             </p>
            <p>
                We have also addressed the unique problem of a professional healthcare working site :
             </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
                <span style="font-size: 12px;">

                    <span class="underline">Privacy and Security concerns.</span>
                    An official local site manager approves members and manages contents because he/she
                    knows the situation best.
                    Requiring the member to submit the hospital ID photo badge during registration helps in the vetting process.
                    <br/>
                    <span class="underline">
                        Intuitive website design and simple navigation:
                    </span>
                    Everyone should be able to use the site without any learning pain.
                    <Br/>

                    <span class="underline">
                        No additional workload is involved in running the site.
                    </span>
                    On the contrary, the site reduces workload.
                </span>
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Once hospital operating room groups are formed,
                the next logical group to form is to form special interest lounges where members can socialize within their own specialties.
            </p>
            <p>
                There will be further enhancement of the site.
                They include introducing new messaging tools to improve productivity and to help members manage the
                challenging new environment medical practice.
               </p>
            <p>
                Hopefully, this site can increase personal and professional productivity and improve patient care.
               </p>
            <p>
